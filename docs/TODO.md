    - updated mkdocs libs
      - markmap is in conflict with jupyter notebooks via attrs library
      - Possible solutions:
        - get rid of markmap and try to integreate mindmaps from Mermaid
        - get rid of notebooks:
          - use mknotebooks
          - use coderunner
            - it looks nicer but it requires custom code blocks (it requires
              change)
